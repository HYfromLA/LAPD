This is the implementation of our paper Robust Multi-Manifold Clustering via Simplex Paths. We use the file from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35094-knee-point to find the elbow point for the denoising threshold and code from https://mauromaggioni.duckdns.org/?page_id=105 to estimate the intrinsic dimension and noise. To get familiar with the implementation, it will be easy to start with the fancy_shapes_demo.m file because there it shows how to set certain parameters.
